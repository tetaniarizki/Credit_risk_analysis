## **Credit Risk Analysis**

Credit risk is the risk that arises because the borrower does not pay all or part of the receivables or does not pay on time and will cause losses to the company.

The distribution of loans with problem loans will affect liquidity. Due to the emergence of non-performing loans, cash that should have entered and added to the company's liquidity did not occur, resulting in the company's being unable to meet its short-term obligations.

To minimize this credit risk, a process called credit scoring and credit rating is usually carried out on the borrower. The output of this process will be the basis for determining whether **a new loan application is accepted or rejected**.
